                    Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation
                    (EBITDA) is a factor of volume, prices, and cost of production.
                    This measure is calculated by adjusting operating profit for
                    special items and adding depreciation and amortisation and

                    EBITDA margin increased from 52% in FY 2020-21 to 55% in
                    FY 2021-22 primarily due to increase in revenue from
                    operations on account of higher LME prices offset by higher

                      Net profit margin is lower on account of higher ETR due to expiry
