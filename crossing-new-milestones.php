          <p class="para-font20">Given that our operations are dependent on the effective management of natural resources, we, at Hindustan Zinc, have prioritised environment protection as a key tenet of our ESG ethos. We are committed to mitigate the risks and impacts of our operations across the business value chain – right from the start of an operation to its closure and even beyond.</p>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">In the immediate term, we are focussed on accelerating actions to lower carbon emissions generated during our operations. Our environment conservation efforts are driven by a strategic thrust on minimising and mitigating our impact on water, land, air quality, climate, and biodiversity. We are also committed to building harmonious relations with our stakeholders, to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by deploying resource management systems and controls.</p>

          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp mar-t30">ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">The transition to net-zero carbon emissions will create additional demand opportunity for our products – zinc, lead and silver, with expected growth in solar PV panels and energy storage solutions.</p>

          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_green">ALIGNMENT WITH 1.5°C</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">At Hindustan Zinc, we have already embarked on several ambitious goals and action plans to steer our net-zero journey and mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change. As a COP26 Business Leader, the Company has always been actively working towards tackling the repercussions of climate change. From setting steep targets to achieve business sustainability, we have established a stronger governance structure for the realisation of these goals. <b>We have committed ourselves to the long-term target to reach net-zero emission by 2050, in line with the Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius campaign led by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)</b> in partnership with the UN Global Compact and the ‘We Mean Business’ coalition.</p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">In the near-term, our 2025 targets include reducing GHG emissions, extending the implementation of our sustainability standards to our suppliers, reducing dependency on freshwater, besides moving towards zero waste to landfill, among others. Under Sustainability Goal 2025, we aim to achieve 0.5 Mn TCO<sub>2</sub>e GHG emission savings in our operations since the base year – 2017 – as part of our climate risk mitigation efforts. </p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc has a green power capacity of around 354.59 MW, which includes 273.5 MW of wind power (non-captive), 40.42 MW (captive) solar power and 40.67 MW of Waste Heat Recovery Power. All our wind and solar projects are registered under Gold Standard (GS), which is the most rigorous certification standard globally for carbon offset projects. The Gold Standard is an independent certification standard for carbon credits generated from CDM or VER projects. Our Captive Thermal, Solar and Waste Heat Recovery Power plants provide low-cost and reliable power to our operations. Our climate change risk assessment is aligned with guidelines by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and we strive to continually expand our renewable power under our greenhouse gases reduction goals. In alignment with our vision, we are entering into a power purchase agreement with a company for supplying 200 megawatts of renewable power. With this collaboration, about 40% of our thermal power capacity will be taken over by renewable power by 2025. By 2030, about 80% to 90% of our thermal power will be replaced by renewable power. </p>

          <p class="mar-t30">Technology and digitalisation are key to strengthening our ESG footprint and creating a net-zero future. It is our ambition to convert all our mining equipment to battery-operated Electric Vehicles (EVs). To make our mining operations environment-friendly, we plan to invest US$ 1 billion over the next five years to induct electric and battery-operated equipment against that going for replacement and new purchase. </p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a globally recognised means to alleviate dependence on petroleum products and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Therefore, Hindustan Zinc signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Epiroc Rock Drills AB, Normet Group Oy and Sandvik AB to introduce battery electric vehicles (BEV) in its underground mining operations. This makes Hindustan Zinc the first company in India to introduce battery-operated vehicles in underground mines. This partnership will allow the Company to replace diesel-powered equipment with electric vehicles, thus enabling safer and cleaner mining operations.</p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Along with Memorandums of Understanding signed with leading equipment manufacturers, the Company has also deployed passenger EV vehicles, EV forklifts and EV light motor vehicles in its operations. </p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">To align our target with SBTi, we have partnered with CDP India under the SBTi Incubator programme to help accelerate our transition to a low-carbon economy. The incubator aims to achieve reduction of GHG emissions through the uptake of Science-based targets in the long-term, and to set corporates on the path of climate science-based emission reduction targets. </p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Meeting science-based targets in the context of a growing business can be difficult. Responding to this challenge, we have implemented a range of measures to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughout the life cycle. We have made dedicated investments in enabling efficient use of energy and work on gainful utilisation of wastes using environment-friendly methods. This helps the Company steer its efforts towards the achievement of a circular economy in the lifecycle of its operations with the aim of enabling decarbonisation. </p>

          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Our focus is on reprocessing tailing material for extracting left-over minerals, utilisation and sale of by-products for beneficial use, and collaboration with various corporations and industrial sectors for inter-usage of waste/by-products. The reduction in the quantum of waste that needs to be recycled or sent to landfills/incinerators leads to lesser energy consumption. By re-using the recycled material, the Company can save on emissions from production of virgin material.</p>

          <p class="half-berder">
            During the year, the Company
            produced solar power of 80.92 million
            units, waste heat energy of
            211.79 million units and wind power
            of 427.52 million units, leading to
            avoidance of 6.13 lac tonnes of
            GHG emission through green power.
            We achieved our highest green
            power (WHRB + wind + solar) in
            FY 2021-22 and the highest ever
            CERs through green power.

              <p class="wow fadeInUp">Our target to achieve net-zero by 2050 is aligned with our emissions control journey that started with revamping of turbine followed by use of biomass as an alternative fuel in our captive power plant (CPP). It was a critical time when fossil fuel prices went abruptly high due to high demand in international industries coupled with lack of production due to local strictures and restriction on coal import by the government. It was during this time that the team at Hindustan Zinc started researching alternatives to sustain the business and reduce emission levels. With incremental increase in biomass consumption from 1% to 5%, we were able to reduce the coal consumption, its associated GHG emission and costs to move a step closer to our ESG goal.</p>

              <p class="wow fadeInUp">To manage our water impacts efficiently, we first need to understand the specific risks at our operating sites, as well as our overall impact on water resources. To this end, we have conducted a detailed water risk assessment across Hindustan Zinc. The objective of this study was to conduct a sensitivity analysis and stress testing for water-related risks and calculate an apt water pricing structure for the Company. There are various tools available for undertaking such an assessment from which we have used WBCSD’s India Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct and GEMI local water tools, among others, for our study. </p>

              <p class="wow fadeInUp">Using these tools, we have identified and assessed risks and worked out a management strategy. An analysis of  the futuristic scenario by Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas showed that the indicators for water stress are high in most of our locations. Regardless of the level, however, we apply rigorous standards and processes to manage risks.</p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">We are committed to zero liquid discharge across our locations. During the year, the Debari zinc smelter successfully commissioned a 3,000 kilolitre per day (KLD) zero liquid discharge ZLD plant. The move is aligned with our vision of ‘Zero Harm – Zero Waste – Zero Discharge’. We are striving to develop sustainable social solutions for a greener future by strengthening our zero discharge.</p> 

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">The newly installed RO-ZLD plant recycles processed water, which is then reused in operations, enabling complete utilisation of the wastewater, which ensures that there is no discharge. The salt generated can also be reused in the leaching process in place of the commercial sodium sulphate being used currently. </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">We plan to commission ZLD plants at all our units and remain committed to principles of water conservation and zero discharge. Expansion of 3,200 KLD ZLD plant at Dariba Smelter is under progress and shall be commissioned by Q2 of FY 2022-23. At Zawar Mines (ZM) and Rampura Agucha Mine (RAM) too, ZLD projects of 4,000 KLD capacity each have been initiated to improve recycling and strengthen the zero discharge. Like ZM, a dry tailing plant at Rajpura Dariba Mine (RDM) is also in the final stage of commissioning. It will result in significant amount of water recovery from the tailing. </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">With these RO-ZLD Plants, we will be able to increase water recycling and minimise fresh water usage, as this waste water is evaporated in solar evaporation pond so far to maintain Zero Liquid Discharge status. Our ZLD projects and dry tailing plants helped us scale our water recycling by 44% in FY 2021-22 from 39% in the previous fiscal.</p>
                <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_black">Rampura Agucha Mine Groundwater Recharge Structures</h3>
                <p class="wow fadeInUp">In consonance with our focus on enhancing ground water recharge through rainwater harvesting projects, we have created an estimated recharge potential of 8.7 million cubic metres per annum of rainwater, covering 84 ponds in 43 villages near the Rampura Agucha Mine location. Through 358 recharge structures, it is expected to increase the availability of good-quality groundwater in the area, resulting in sustainable water availability for various purposes, besides securing the livelihood of villagers.</p> 

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">The initiative is estimated to benefit 70,000-75,000 people living in this area. As a result of the project, crop patterns and yields will also increase. </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp">We are also committed to build rainwater harvesting structures in nearby villages, to make them water sufficient. These efforts are targeted to multiply the benefits of our operations in society and put Hindustan Zinc on track to become 5 times water positive by 2025.</p>

          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp mar-t30">MANAGING TAILINGS DAMS EFFECTIVELY</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Responsibly managing waste from mining operations is crucial to ensure business sustainability. Any failure in tailing management can result in disaster, and hence, it is essential to communicate to stakeholders’ details of our tailing storage facilities and how we manage them. Hindustan Zinc has implemented global leading practices in tailing dam management, and we are associating with renowned global experts to provide long-term monitoring and advice on the design, construction, and operation of our three tailing storage facilities. Overall good construction quality, along with upgradation of tailing slurry transport and discharge lines through installation of piezometers (and inclinometer) with automated data collection and web-based monitoring, make it world-class.</p>
          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_sblue">EXISTING TAILING DAMS AT THE MINES</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">We recognise the impact of mine tailing and tailing facilities on the environment, nearby communities, and other stakeholders. We are taking extensive measures for construction, operation, maintenance, and closure of facilities that mitigate the risk of tailing dam failure. We incorporate the best available technologies as guided by Vedanta’s Tailing Management Facility Standard. Wherever possible, we repurpose tailing materials and waste rock as backfill to stabilise our underground mining operations. Remaining tailing are then placed in a specially designed tailing storage to minimise the environmental, social, and economic risks.</p>
          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_sblue">TAILING MANAGEMENT PLAN</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Tailing management plans are an essential prerequisite for sound storage practice, as most failures of tailing storages around the world result from inadequate management of the storages. Effective implementation of a management plan not only results in a safer tailing storage facility (TSF) but will frequently reduce overall costs associated with operation and closure of the facility. </p>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">All our operating mines have a Tailing Management Plan – an Operations, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) manual. It describes</p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">
            <li class="wow fadeInUp">Roles and responsibilities of TSF Committee (Governing Tailing Management) </li>

          <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_sblue">MIYAWAKI AFFORESTATION</h3>
          <p class="wow fadeInUp">Miyawaki is a technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, which helps build dense, native forests. The approach is supposed to ensure that plant growth is 10 times faster and the resulting plantation is 30 times denser than conventional landscapes and tree plantation. It involves planting dozens of native species in the same area, which becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. These forests, which are full of biodiversity, retain groundwater, thus recharging the groundwater table. They attract more birds, produce native fruits, and improve the aesthetics as well. This technique of growing Miyawaki forests is completely chemical-free and sustains itself while supporting local biodiversity. We have successfully implemented a pilot project at Zinc Smelter Debari and will replicate it across all our units.</p>
          <div class="left-btm-berd">
            <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_org">OUTCOMES</h3>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp">1 Acre (0.4 hectares) area in Debari colony developed through this technique, with nearly 50 types of native species and 8,000 plantations.</p>
