						<div class="all-insides">
							<p class="para-font20">Our dialogue with stakeholders guides
								our strategic planning, helps to reimagine
								business purpose, and allows us to
								monitor operations and outcomes across
								each stakeholder group. The process of
								stakeholder engagement is at the heart
								of what we do, bringing in profound
								awareness of relevant issues, and guiding
								the implementation of initiatives for positive
								change. It is our belief that bringing
								various relevant stakeholders onboard
								for an open and productive dialogue is
								critical for long-term sustainability of the
								organisation and helps to uphold values of
							responsible business.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">At Hindustan Zinc, proactive engagement with our
								stakeholders has made way for mutually beneficial
								sustainable outcomes and accelerated the implementation
								of all our strategic interventions. Initiatives range from
								driving sustainable consumption patterns to mitigating
								environmental impact, incorporating, and implementing
								human rights principles, instilling values via codes of
								conduct for upliftment of communities, besides meaningful
								contribution to the nationâ€™s growth and development, all of
								which have required active participation of stakeholders
								including customers, suppliers/vendors, business partners,
							local people, government etc.</p>

							

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">For effective stakeholder engagement, we have
								established the Stakeholder Engagement Standard. The
								process is streamlined at all sites where identification and
								analysis of each stakeholder is conducted. This exercise
								ensures smooth dialogue as a channel to enable a two-way
							engagement between the organisation and stakeholders.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">We identify stakeholders as those individuals or groups
								that have interests or are directly or indirectly affected
								by the impact of our business activities and decisions.
								At an organisational level, specific teams help to identify
								stakeholders who may have been otherwise overlooked
								or gone unnoticed due to a position of disadvantage. The
								actual and predicted impact for each stakeholder group is
								identified based on locally-gathered information. From this,
								Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEPs) are derived, and
							periodically reviewed and updated as needed.</p>

							<div class="st-org">
								<h3 class="head-font20 clr_black">Stakeholder identification helps us

									<li>Positive and negative impacts of our

							MECHANISM</h3>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc identifies grievances as an expression
								of dissatisfaction by any stakeholder caused by factual
								or perceived incidents. The Company regularly engages
								relevant stakeholders to allow the Company to gain a
								holistic view of its business. A Grievance Committee,
								chaired by the respective unit heads is in place to address
								and resolve grievances. An apex committee, chaired by
								the location head, meets every quarter and the unit level
								committee meets every month and is apprised of the
								grievances received and action taken by the respective
								committees. As leaders of industry, we ensure that all
								grievances are acknowledged, assessed and a satisfactory
								response is communicated to the complainant in a
							time-bound manner.</p>

							<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp">HOW WE ARE ENGAGING WITH
							OUR STAKEHOLDERS</h3>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">To facilitate effective stakeholder engagement, the
								Company reaches out on multiple stakeholder-specific
								platforms that encompasses all relevant stakeholders. This
								process helps minimise reputational risk and protect brand
								image, while strengthening our bond with stakeholders
								by keeping open all channels of communication to reach
							wider audiences.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">To monitor and measure progress, we have in place a
