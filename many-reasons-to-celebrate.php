      <h6>Sometimes, events happen to change the course of history. And at others, history scripts events that redefine the journey itself. FY 2021-22 was such a defining year, a year that saw organisations worldwide charting a new, more cautious course for the future.</h6>
      <p>But at Hindustan Zinc, it was not a year of taking a pause or changing the future course. Rather it was a year of accelerating the pace of our efforts to surge aggressively forward on the roadmap of our strategic plans and goals. It was a year of transforming moments into milestones and events into celebrations.</p>

      <p>FY 2021-22 was for us a year of rejoicing in the multitude of awards and rankings we won for our innovative initiatives, operational excellence, technological scale-up, people-centric policies and strong sustainability ethos. More importantly, however, it was a year of celebrating the spirit of our people who made it possible for us to accomplish exceptional feats in the most testing of times.</p>

      <p>It was a year of revelling in the success of our internal policies, programmes and efforts, which helped us navigate the external challenges and complexities seamlessly and efficaciously. It was a year of cherishing our collective hopes and nurturing our shared vision of leaving indelible footprints in the sands of time.</p>

      <p>Today, as we look back at those imprints, we see in them hopes of notching even more memorable
      moments and milestones in our onward journey. They inspire us not just to celebrate our wins of the past year but celebrate to win even bigger and better, going forward!</p>
