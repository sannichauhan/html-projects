            <p class="wow fadeInUp">A sustainable business is one that serves an enduring purpose in society, and considers, in all its decision-making, the varied forms of value it can deliver to all stakeholders, including the natural environment. We, at Hindustan Zinc, have made sustainability central to our growth and value-creation journey, and remain focussed on ensuring safe operations with minimum environmental impact of our business across the lifecycle. We have ingrained into the organisational fabric a strong sense of respect for human rights, and the ethos of sharing the benefits of business with our stakeholders. Our strategic approach is aligned with national and international standards, Sustainable Development Goals, and driven by the vision of the Company’s leadership.</p> 

            <p class="wow fadeInUp">In the year 2020, we set out a series of goals, spanning the full breadth of Environmental (E), Social (S) and Governance (G), in the shape of our Sustainability Goals 2025. While we have made good progress towards the delivery of those goals, we recognise that as the world changes, society’s expectations from us also evolve. Our commitments must be relevant and capable of bridging any gaps, to help the business expand. Just as financial performance presents an opportunity for differentiation, we see sustainability no differently – it is integral to our work, and business performance.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInUp">Our sustainability vision is centred on <b>‘ZERO HARM, ZERO DISCHARGE, ZERO WASTE’,</b> and our ambitious sustainability journey is steered by our Sustainability Goals 2025. For us, these goals constitute an action agenda to achieve our long-term ambition of creation and delivery of value to our stakeholders, across the value chain. We strongly believe that these goals will enable us to address the expectations of our stakeholders, while giving us many reasons to celebrate our journey of inclusive and holistic growth, and value creation.</p>

            <h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp">OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK</h3>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp">At Hindustan Zinc, we have implemented a three-tiered sustainability governance framework to organise our thoughts and ideas, undertake informed planning, evaluate activities, and ensure accountability on all aspects of environmental, social, and governance issues. The framework also enables us to set short-term and long-term goals and monitor performance systematically in alignment with our sustainability priorities at every level of the organisation.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">During the year, we enhanced our focus on sustainability and ESG by constituting a separate Sustainability and ESG Committee at the Board level. The committee consists of four members, and its meeting for FY 2021-22 was held on December 27, 2021. The role of the Sustainability and ESG Committee is to assist the Board in meeting its responsibilities in ESG matters and to ensure strong governance for sustainability. It is responsible for providing guidance to ensure continual improvement in our sustainability performance and the implementation of appropriate processes and policies across the Company. The committee is responsible for structuring our sustainability strategy, and long-term goals and targets. It also plays a key strategic role in business decisions to ensure workplace safety, eliminate potential damage to the environment, enhance our commitment towards stakeholders, and maintain the Company’s reputation as a leader in the sustainable metal and mining sector.</p>

The committee meets monthly to review the progress on all Sustainability Goals 2025. It is responsible for formulating the sustainability strategy, and the long-term goals and targets of the Company. It plays a strategic role in all business decisions for ensuring workplace safety. The focus is on eliminating any potential damage to the environment, in line with the Company’s stakeholder commitment and maintaining its reputation. </p>
                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">To drive the Sustainability Goals 2025, we have established the following sustainability communities to review progress against their respective goals. These committees that comprise the champions of all the units, meet once a month.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The Sodium Sulphate Recovery Plant at Dariba Smelting Complex is operational and the quality of salt generated is suitable for jarosite precipitation, a procedure for removal of iron and lead impurities during zinc extraction. This has reduced hazardous mixed salt generation by <span class="middle-al">~</span>10%. </p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">We conducted a detailed analysis of RO rejects mixed salt generated at Debari and Dariba smelter. Mixed salts generated from Dariba Zinc smelter, were found suitable for use by the soap industry, targeting utilisation of 1,500 tonnes of mixed salt in the manufacture of soap and detergent instead of being disposed in a Secured Landfill Facility (SLF).</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">We are working in collaboration with various national and international institutes and technology providers for metal recovery and utilisation of tailing and jarosite. There are ongoing laboratory trials to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of metal recovery from Rampura Agucha Mine tailing and jarosite/jarofix generated in our smelters.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">During the year, 93,778 tonnes of Jarosite has been gainfully utilised in cement manufacturing. To further enhance Jarosite utilisation in cement manufacturing, we have been able to control the moisture content in Jarosite by optimum use of reagents, with this successful trial. We are targeting nearly 2 lac tonnes of Jarosite utilisation in FY 2022-23.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The Company has been granted permission by Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board for gainful utilisation of jarofix waste in the construction of roads and highways, including embankments. We have partnered with some government agencies like NCCBM, NEERI and CRRI for the utilisation of jarosite in cement and road construction.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Our Research and Development (R&D) capabilities are playing an important role in propelling our circular economy goals. We are exploring various technologies for metal recovery from various residues and waste. R&D has taken up the challenge to increase metal recoveries and improve the process efficiency by implementing geo-metallurgy at mills and tracking of losses in tailing through an automated minerology setup. On smelting R&D is developing sustainable technologies in-house and in collaboration with institutes and technology providers. </p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">The Company has been able to improve its metal recovery from beneficiation plants through digitalisation.</p>

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">An Advanced Process Control (APC) System was introduced to stabilise circuit operations while optimising the process performance to maximise metal recovery. Three APCs were implemented for grinding and flotation operations (Lead and Zinc) in mills at Rampura Agucha and SK Mines. </p>
