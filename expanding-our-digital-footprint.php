								<div class="curly-border">

									<h4 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp wow fadeInUp clr_white">Improving Recovery through APC<br>MAXIMISING THROUGHPUT AND OPTIMISING ENERGY CONSUMPTION
									</h4>

									<p class="wow fadeInUp">The Advanced Process Controller (APC) is used at Hindustan Zinc in the grinding and flotation processes. It is
										meant to improve recovery of metals and optimise energy consumption in the beneficiation process. APC is a
										control system that operates on the principle of ‘Stabilise & Optimise’ that helps to attain optimal throughput
									and optimise metal recovery balancing. It also helps to keep the concentrate grade within acceptable limits.</p>
									<p class="clr_white"><b>As part of the Initiative
									</b></p>
									
									<ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">APCs were implemented for grinding & flotation operations (lead and zinc) in RA and SK mills</li>
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">APC was used to maximise the throughput and improve recovery of metal</li>
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">It was also concurrently used to maintain optimum levels of concentrate grade</li>
									</ul>
									

									<p class="wow fadeInUp clr_white"><b>Benefits
									</b></p>

									<ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">Stabilisation of process parameters across milling plants</li>
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">Significant reduction in standard deviation of key process parameters</li>
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">>1% improvement in Zn & Pb recovery, resulting in additional volume</li>
										<li class="wow fadeInUp">Significant improvement in grade control of the concentrate and reduction in its variability</li>

							<h3 class="head-font20 mar-t30">NORTHSTAR</h3>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp">NorthStar/Hexa is our in-house								reporting, visualisation and data
								analytics tool assisting teams across
								departments. It provides us with
								real-time data to enable sophisticated
								data-driven decision-making.
								NorthStar/Hexa has empowered
								both business functions and on-site teams to effectively leverage
								data to streamline operations.
								It has facilitated stakeholders in
								taking important business decisions
								independently through process
							automation across locations.</p>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp"><b>NorthStar was conceptualised and
							implemented</b> to build a single source
							of truth to enhance data governance,
							visualisation, and reporting. It was
							envisioned to engage with different
							departments/functions by analysing
							their working and implementing
							digital transformation to derive
							maximum business value. In our
							efforts to digitally transform the
							organisation through an end-to-end trusted data governance tool,
							insights from NorthStar have helped
							streamline processes and reporting
							in several departments, including
							Operations, Commercial, Finance,
							and HR. These insights have led
							to improvement in efficiency and
						enhanced performance.</p>

						<p class="wow fadeInUp"><b>Since its inception in 2020,
							NorthStar has assisted more than
							500 employees across multiple
							locations. It supports employees
							with more than 30 live dashboards
							and over 100 live reports with varied
							frequency of circulation ranging,
							from twice a day to once a month.
							It has, over the past two years,
							evolved into a single repository
							of data, originating from more
						than six data sources.</b> Business
						stakeholders at all levels, including
						top management, have reposed
						their faith in the dashboards and
						reports, which have facilitated the
						accomplishment of crucial business
						goals, and has helped us achieve one
					milestone after another.</p>

					<p class="wow fadeInUp">The journey of NorthStar’s evolution
						has not been easy. In the early days
						of implementation, it was an onerous
						task to enable departments to realise
						the business value of automated
						reports and dynamic dashboards.
						Creating awareness among functions,
						by targeting low hanging fruits to
						highlight output and further scope,
						was the most important step for
						the implementation of this system.
						Further, integration of various data
						sources onto a single platform
						needed co-ordination and co-
						operation among different functions.
						Building a bridge of trust between the
						owners and users of the dashboards
						and reports, to create a trustworthy
						and engaging ecosystem to derive
						maximum business value, was indeed
						a challenge. Creating a framework to
						evaluate user requirements, feasibility
						parameters, and business impact
						was a crucial step on this journey to
					ensure the success of this project.</p>
