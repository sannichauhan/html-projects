A new field hospital was established in Dariba, with a capacity of 100 beds, air conditioning facility and medical assistance. Apart from these efforts, the Company extended all kinds of support to the local health administration in the battle against COVID. Unfortunately, however, we lost 59 employees and contract employees to COVID during the first and second waves.</p> 

                      <p class="wow fadeInUp">Mega vaccination drives were organised for all employees, business partners and their family members, during the year. The Company also introduced the Group Corona Kavach Policy that covers more than <span class="middle-al">~</span>25,000 business partners. This cashless policy covers all corona-related diagnostic charges, including pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses. There is also a dedicated 24x7 COVID care Apollo helpline number to provide any kind of healthcare support and assistance to employees and their dependents. Post-COVID care drives was also initiated to boost employees’ motivation. The Company also rolled out Group Term Life policy, which provides life (term) insurance protection in case of death of an active regular executive. The coverage limit is 5x the fixed salary of each employee up to a maximum limit of ₹5.5 crore.</p>

Additionally, we conduct trainings through virtual reality-based modules and simulator training. Hindustan Zinc has also deploying IoT solutions for the safety of its employees and equipment. Use of connected workforce solutions like safety wearables and tags assures proactive use of technolog to ensure employees safety and alert the management about any safety concerns to enable priority intervention for necessary support and rescue. Detect technology is another instance of IoT that uses artificial intelligence and video analytics from existing CCTV cameras to identify and capture unsafe conditions and unsafe acts. Timely reporting helps the line leadership to act promptly against unsafe observations and build round-the-clock assurance to prevent safety incidents. Through this technology, we have enabled an autonomous system for detection of safety violations during turnarounds through a network of cameras, supported by back-end data analytics and front-end real-time reporting.</p>

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc’s Rampura Agucha Mine launched a unique virtual reality-based simulator training for operators using its ground-mounted Koepe winder system, for hoisting heavy loads from deep shafts. </p> 

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">This simulator training for the first time in India, provides a smooth virtual walkthrough for operators and familiarises them with the winding system. It allows operators to practice in different scenarios and critical situations, thus serving to not only improve performance but also enhance safety and productivity.</p>

                        <h4 class="head-font18 wow fadeInUp">SIMULATOR TRAINING</h4>
                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">To make mining safer and productive, simulators are used for training people for the operation of critical equipment like LPDT, LHD and jumbo drills. Training through simulators helps operators develop required skills and competencies. The simulated environment allows operators to test on specific equipment without using actual mobile equipment or exposing others to unnecessary hazards. We measure each operator’s reaction time against specific performance criteria, that helps us to assess training and development needs. The training programme begins with a pre-assessment of hand-eye co-ordination to determine each potential candidate’s capabilities. Once successful candidates have demonstrated the appropriate theoretical knowledge, they are trained on a simulator for the specific equipment they will be using and be licensed for. Next, candidates begin practice on actual equipment on-site, under the guidance of an experienced operator. Once they have had a successful assessment, they are licensed to operate the equipment.</p> 

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">During the year, 0.54 million man-hours of safety trainings were imparted to employees and contract employees.</p>
