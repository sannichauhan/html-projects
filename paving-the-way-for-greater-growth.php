										<p>To leverage the emerging global opportunities, we are continually investing in
											expanding our production capacities. We have established 1.2 Mtpa of mined metal
											capacity and are now working on further expanding the same. Going forward, we
											are aiming to further ramp-up our underground mines to deliver on the designed
											capacity of 1.2 Mtpa. A new beneficiation plant is also planned at Rajpura Dariba
											Mines to increase treatment capacity from 1.1 Mtpa to 1.5 Mtpa. Also in the future,
											we plan to commission a new ZLD plant at Rampura Agucha and Zawar. In addition,
											at Balaria, which is part of Zawar group of mines, new production centre is under
											consideration. Further, with the supporting mined metal flow, smelters are geared
											to touch approx. 1,000 – 1,025 kt. We are also planning to include one more roaster
											in our smelting operations, followed by expansion of our leaching and cell house
											capacity (currently under Board approval). The commissioning of Fumer is also
										proposed to be completed in FY 2022-23.</p>
										<p>By FY 2024-25, we expect to further ramp-up capacity of underground mines to
											1.35 Mtpa capacity. With commissioning of new zinc smelter of 150 kt capacity,
											zinc metal production will increase and contribute to achieve the envisioned
											refined metal capacity. We also target to scale-up silver production to 800 MT and
											gradually to 1,000 MT in line with our vision to be in top 3 global primary silver
											producers from the 6<sup>th</sup> position currently.</p>

												<p>We remain concertedly focussed on
													increasing the longevity of our mines to
													drive future growth and value. As of March
													31, 2022, our total ore reserves stands
													at 161.2 million tonnes (net of depletion
													of FY 2021-22 production of 16.3 million
													tonnes), as against 150.3 million tonnes
													at the end of FY 2020-21. The increase
													was on account of our heightened focus
													on resource to reserve conversion. Our Exclusive Mineral Resource totalled 286.73 million tonnes at the end of FY 2021-22, while
													the combined R&R was estimated to be 448 million tonnes, including 31.1 million tonnes
													of zinc-lead metal and 874.7 million ounces of silver. The overall mine life continues to be
												over 25 years.</p>
												<p>In the next phase of our growth, we are targeting ore generation at Kayad and Rampura
													Agucha Mines by integrating application of artificial intelligence & machine learning with
													existing geological data in FY 2022-23. We are also looking at increased exploration to
													enhance our Mineral Resource by 20 Mt Ore (with contained metal of 1.0 Mt), which we aim
												to further augment by another 40 Mt Ore by FY 2024-25 (with contained metal of 2.0 Mt).</p>
												<p>It is estimated that ore reserves upgradation of 28 Mt will translate into a total R&R of
													470 Mt in FY 2022-23. We shall also seek to secure SK north / SK south PL and other new
													tenements for R&R growth which will further increase total R&R to 500+ Mt, with ~35 Mt
													Metal by FY 2024-25. Going forward, we shall focus on application of advance geophysics
												techniques for target generation in strike/down dip extension of mineralisation.</p>

												<p>Prudent cost management is important to deliver value-led, sustainable growth. Led
													by this belief, we successfully maintained our focus on improving cost efficiencies
												during the year.</p>
												<p>Despite disruptions triggered by COVID-19, we posted record ore production of
													16.3 million tonnes, while mined metal production stood at 1,017 kt and refined zinc-lead
													production at 967 kt. The Dariba Zinc Smelter posted its highest ever production, with
													92% efficiency. The production increased was facilitated by our focussed initiatives to
													promote operational and cost excellence. These included completion of the cell house
													revamp at Zinc Smelter Debari (ZSD), commissioning of Advanced Process Controllers
													(APCs) at the beneficiation plants of Rampura Agucha and Sindesar Khurd Mines,
													and commencement of Zinc Oxide treatment at Fumer Circuit CLZS for additional FG
													production. Digitisation and automation, along with power optimisation and innovative
												transportation and shaft hauling processes, further helped promote cost excellence.</p>
												<p>During FY 2022-23, we shall strive to maintain cost of production between US$ 1,125 -
													US$ 1,175 per tonne through efficient ore hauling, higher volume and grades, as well as
													higher productivity, through our automation and digitalisation initiatives. We shall work
													towards maintaining all cell house operations at their currently efficiency levels of 92%
													without any interruption of MIC. We plan to run Pyro on Lead mode to reduce the Zinc
												COP, and also to improve Lead and Silver production.</p>
												<p>Further ahead, by FY 2024-25, through our continued focus on delivering volumes,
													keeping a tight watch on cost rationalisation and operational efficiencies, we aim to reduce
													cost of production to below US$ 1,000 per tonne. We shall further undertake automation
													and mechanisation of the Dariba Lead cell house and Debari cell house to reduce cost and
												concurrently increase efficiency and recovery.</p>

												<p>To cater to the increasing minor metal
													demand, we are looking at scaling up
													our capacities for minor metal recovery,
													going forward. We are also investing in
													the development of new products through
													downstream applications. Our key focus
													area in this context is innovation of new
													products in lead alloys and increased
												penetration of zinc alloys.</p>
												<p>We are also continuously scaling up Value Added Product (VAP) production in our primary
													metals portfolio. We produce two types of VAP – 1) Continuous Galvanising Grade (CGG),
													which is used by Steel Galvanizing companies, with the final product finding use in
													construction, and 2) Hindustan Zinc Die Casting Alloy (HZDA), which is used by Die Casting
												companies, with the final product being utilised by the automobile and architectural sector.</p>
												<p>With both the construction and auto sector picking up along with renewed focus on smart
													city and infrastructure projects is generating high demand for customised products.
													Through our subsidiary HZAPL, we are increasingly focussing on meeting domestic
												demand for zinc alloy products to enhance our VAP portfolio as a go-to-market strategy.</p>
												<p>Thereby, our share of VAP increased to 20.0% in FY 2021-22 from 15.5% in the previous
												year and target to increase it to 24% by FY 2024-25.</p>

												<p>Hindustan Zinc has consciously adopted a strategic approach that is crafted to drive its
													efforts to progressively reduce its carbon footprint. Our audacious Sustainability Goals
													2025, as well as voluntary & progressive ESG-related disclosures in line with global
													best-practices, underline our commitment to responsible growth. They underscore
													our concerted efforts towards reduction in GHG emissions reduction, along with water
													stewardship, circular economy, biodiversity conservation and waste management.
													Innovation is central to our 3R (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) waste approach and adoption of
												greener technologies to the maximum possible extent.</p>
												<p>The constitution of a Board-level ESG Committee is a major step forward in steering us
													towards the realisation of our Sustainability Goals. We are continuously striving to promote
													conservation of natural resources and restore the natural land and water systems to drive
													our transition to a circular economy. Responsible local sourcing is another key facet of our
													focus on powering a circular economy. Introduction of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in
													underground mines is a major step taken by the Company, a COP26 business leader, to
												drive it closer to achieving carbon neutrality.</p>
												<p>In FY 2022-23, we are looking at migration to 100% mechanised charging at Zawar for
													improved safety, faster charging and increased pull per blast. Cognisant of our ESG and
													Net-Zero goals, we are also looking at establishment of 200 MW green power to reduce
													COP, besides modification of the existing circuits to enable waste management through
												Jarosite utilisation.</p>
