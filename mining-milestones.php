										<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_org">Skill Assessment
										</h3>
										<p class="wow fadeInUp">To identify areas for improvement, a robust skill assessment exercise of Kayad mine’s executive employees
											was undertaken during the year under review. Based on the assessment, a training calendar was prepared
											to ensure skill gap mitigation for all manpower at the site. Further, to boost productivity, and to assess the
										safety and operational improvement areas, a skill mapping and assessment exercise was also carried out for contract workers. </p>
										<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_org">Special Training</h3>
										<p class="wow fadeInUp">A special training programme on Cracking FCMM Certifications was held with the support of an expert former government official. Barring two, all participants passed the exam, aimed at building a robust talent pipeline.</p>
										<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_org">6-day Extensive Training Programme for mining mates

										</h3>
										<p class="wow fadeInUp">This was conducted by ex DDG, DGMS, to improve the competency levels of mining mates with respect

											<li>Maintenance of Zero Liquid Discharge</li>

											<li>Specific water consumption at 0.027 m<sup>3</sup>/MT against target of 0.030 m<sup>3</sup>/MT</li>

											<li>Treatment of wet/food related waste in organic compost machine</li>

											<li>Control of fugitive emissions with road sweeping machine and water spray</li>

										</ul>

										<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_black">Solar Panel Online Data Monitoring via SCADA

										</h3>
										<p class="wow fadeInUp">Kayad Mine is monitoring real-time power generation and consumption metrics, along with other critical
										working parameters of all inverters. Solar site monitoring is done using a specialised camera to assess the physical conditions at the site, besides ensuring upkeep to avoid any interruption to the operations.</p>

										<div class="tedt-gr">
											<ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">
												<li>In line with our people-centric philosophy, we, at Hindustan Zinc, have put in place several protective
												measures to keep our employees and business partners safe and secure amid the COVID-19 crisis. We had launched a host of programmes and initiatives when the pandemic first broke out in India. During FY 2021-22, we further strengthened the safety network and expanded the ambit of our initiatives.</li>

												<li>We implemented a well-articulated COVID-19 Management Plan with the help of a Special Task Force (STF), which ensured field execution and helped organise awareness sessions.</li>

												<li>A COVID-19 helpline centre was developed for connecting infected employees and business partners
												with their families</li>

												<li>A team was deployed 24x7 with a well-established control room at colony premises</li>

												<li>For smooth running of mine operations, special arrangements were made for dedicated isolation centres at hospital with 30-bed capacity and at DAV school with 100-bed capacity</li>

												<li>A mega COVID vaccination drive was carried out for our employees, business partners, family members and villagers in the eligible age group</li>

												<li>We tied up with a private lab for COVID-19 RTPCR testing with home collection of samples, and with a 
												hospital for handling exigencies</li>

												<li>A thermographic camera and mask detection system was installed at the biometric gate to ensure regular temperature screening and adherence to the mask mandate; face masks, face shields and hand sanitisers were distributed among employees and in the community</li>

												<li>A 24x7 medical facility is in place for regular check-ups at first-aid stations and hospitals

													<li>Periodic disinfection and sanitisation of offices, workplaces and the surrounding community areas was 
													undertaken during the year</li>

													<li>Vaccination certificate is made mandatory for all consultants and service engineers for entry onto
													Hindustan Zinc premises</li>

													<li>During the peak of infections, provisions were made for social distancing, with all meetings and discussions managed through virtual platforms. There was no outside travel, restricted entry to mine, immunity boosting doses and regular sanitisation</li>

													<li>To support all COVID-19 recovered employees, we organised management classes and virtual breathing sessions

											<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp">LOOKING AHEAD</h3>
											<ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">
												<li>Enhance Reserves and Resources to sustain ore production with the use of advanced technology,
												including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The same is deployed to identify new ore blocks and improve the detail of existing blocks thereby leading to better targeting</li>

												<li>Enable growth in operations by investing in development of newly discovered lenses; establish the required infrastructure to boost ore production; and overall secure better grades and higher metal in 
												concentrate production in the years ahead</li>

												<li>Sharp focus on reducing energy consumption and augmenting renewable energy generation</li>

												<li>With the vision to reduce our environmental footprint, our focus will be to further progress on our journey of dry tailings project</li>

												<li>Deploy Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) for underground operations to facilitate underground services such as Shotcreting Equipment and Explosive Charging as well as production equipment such as loaders and trucks. This will support our vision to reduce carbon emissions, improve ventilation and thereby provide a
												better working ambience</li>

												<li>Strive to migrate all production vehicles to Euro-Stage-V Engines by 2025</li>

												<li>Sustain efforts to further reduce cost with increased use of digitalisation and mechanisation, thus leading to better operational efficiencies</li>

												<li>Progress on digitalisation efforts across the mines, including laying of optical fibre network to set-up a high bandwidth underground Wi-fi network, enable Smart equipment to communicate with the mine control room and monitor all equipment health parameters directly from mine control room, all of these will help to augment productivity and reduce cost</li>
