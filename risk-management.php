							<h3 class="head-orgs wow fadeInUp">Robust Systems for Prevention, Early Detection & Mitigation</h3>
							<p class="para-font20 wow fadeInUp">We are cognisant that risk management is critical for realisation of organisation goals.
								The importance of early identification of probable risks, as well as timely formulation
								of strategic plans to mitigate the same, is important to be successful on this count. We,
								therefore, have in place a strong and sustainable risk management framework, supported
								by risk disclosure through various internal online platforms to allow timely escalations and
								actions. Risks are clearly defined with specific management targets and indicators, which
								are in turn mapped across categories, class, and their potential impact, and evaluated on
							a regular basis.</p>
							<h3 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp">RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, AWARENESS & GOVERNANCE</h3>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp">As per requirement of SEBI (LODR), the Board has formed
								a Risk Management Committee to oversee the mitigation
								plan for the risks faced by the Company. Risk Management
								is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is part of
								the Risk Management Committee. The CRO’s roles and
								responsibilities include keeping the senior management
								aware of all existing and emerging risks at asset and
								business levels. The CRO additionally guides strategic
								business unit (SBU) heads, who are equally responsible for
								managing risk in their respective business units. Necessary
								awareness and specific training sessions are conducted
							periodically across all business units.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">To ensure further transparency and critical assessment
								of risk, we have a group management assurance system
								that co-ordinates the risk management framework, which
								is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee on behalf of
							the Board. These efforts are further supported by a Board.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">Level Risk Management Committee comprising the CEO,
								CFO and Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Head of
								our group management assurance, along with CRO, CHRO,
								CCO, COO Mines and COO Smelters, is a permanent
								invitee. The Risk Management Committee discusses key
								events impacting the risk profile and emerging risks, and
							monitors progress against the planned action.</p>
							<p class="half-berder wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc’s risk management system is
							certified as per ISO 31000:2018</p>

							<img src="images/hindustan-2.svg" class="mar-t30 img-responsive wow zoomIn" alt="">

							<p class="mar-t30 wow fadeInUp">Our risk management framework is well-structured and allows us to identify, assess, categorise, address, and mitigate
								both positive opportunities and negative consequences associated with our business. These are regularly monitored,
								tracked, and reviewed through a robust Governance and Process architecture, with roles and responsibilities clearly
							defined for each stage.</p>

							<p class="wow fadeInUp">Cybersecurity is vital in the digital age that characterises the increasingly connected world we live in. The COVID-19

							no significant disruptions.</p>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp">The operating and control systems at our mines increasingly leverage high-tech solutions. These systems, although crucial
								for operating the mines safely and efficiently, are vulnerable to evolving cyber threats and security breaches. Consequently,
							cybersecurity has emerged as one of our most significant business risks.</p>
							<p class="wow fadeInUp">Cyber-related threats will continue to grow, with malicious actors targeting organisations with extortion through
								ransomware. Maintaining cybersecurity across our operations is an ongoing process, and we remain committed to ensure

		<h3 class="head-font20 mar-t30 wow fadeInUp clr_sblue">MANAGEMENT OF CYBERSECURITY RISKS</h3>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Our Cybersecurity Framework
			details a principle and objective-based approach to protect the
			confidentiality, integrity, and
			availability of all technology and data
			assets, including those we rely on
			in our operations. The standard is
			particularly applicable to all assets
			that are critical for business and
			operational resilience, as well as
			stability and regulatory compliance.
			The framework focusses on the risks
		and critical controls around our assets.</p>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Additionally, several other standards
			and guidelines support the framework
			and govern HZL’s information
			technology and cybersecurity
			practices. These include the
			information security management
			and personal data privacy standards,
			disaster recovery and business
			continuity management, and
		risk management.</p>
		<p class="half-berder wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc received an
			Integrated ISO Certification,
			consisting of ISO 27001 (Information
			Security), ISO 22301 (DR & BCP),
			ISO 31000 (Risk Management) and
			ISO 27701 (Privacy Management),
			during 2021. We are committed to
			minimising business risks and have
			incorporated the NIST cybersecurity
			information framework into our
			cybersecurity operating model
		at all levels.</p>

		<h3 class="head-font20 mar-t70 clr_sblue">POLICY ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK</h3>
		<ul class="list-unstyled all-ul-li">


			<li class="wow fadeInUp">All policies and procedures
				enforced within the Hindustan Zinc
				environment are comprehensively
				developed to manage various
				information security and data
			governance aspects</li>
			<li class="wow fadeInUp">All these policies are reviewed
				annually by competent personnel
			in the information security function</li>
			<li class="wow fadeInUp">All the approved and enforced
				policies are made available to employees and business partners
				on the Company’s intranet portal.
				Communication is also sent
				to all stakeholders when any
				change is carried out in any of the
				policies or procedures
			</li>
			<li class="wow fadeInUp">For assurance, all policies and
				procedures are reviewed on
				a regular basis and audited
				for compliance. Hindustan
				Zinc conducts and undergoes various assessments during the
				year to identify vulnerabilities,
				threats, shortcomings, and
			associated risk/impact</li>

			<li class="wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc has also adopted
				a proven process of third-party
				risk management (TPRM) for
				all its key business partners
				including vendors, suppliers and
			service partners</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="head-font20 clr_sblue">OPERATIONALISING CYBERSECURITY & INFORMATION SECURITY</h3>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Our cyber programme focusses on four strategic areas aimed at enhancing
		cybersecurity capabilities across the business to minimise risks:</p>

		<h3 class="head-font20 clr_org">1. Vulnerability Management</h3>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Risks and vulnerabilities are
			identified and addressed across the
			IT, OT, and digital landscape in line
			with the Company’s vulnerability
			management policy. Internal and
			external vulnerability assessment
			and penetrating testing (VAPT)
			programme, surveillance audit,
			assessment of IT general controls
			(ITGC) are carried out by globally
			reputed and recognised third-party
		agencies on an annual basis.</p>
		<h3 class="head-font20 clr_org">2. Information Security
		Administration</h3>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Observations and points emanating
			from risk controls matrix, review
			controls and open observations
			reported through various assessments
			and actions emerging from the
			annual IT risk assessment and DR/
			BCP reviews are tracked as part of
			the CIO’s monthly review, in addition
			to the reviews carried out by other
		internal and external forums.</p>

		<h3 class="head-font20 clr_org">3. Incident Management
			& Response (Cyber & Data
		Incidents)</h3>

		<p class="wow fadeInUp">All security incidents are tracked
			and monitored till their logical
			closure, including root cause analysis
			and action plan to mitigate similar
			incidents in the future, under the
			incident management and data
			breach policy. Every reported
			incident is investigated by the CISO,
			and action is taken to address the
			incident reported through a common
			e-mail. Hindustan Zinc has also
			implemented multiple best-in-class
			tools and technologies (SIEM &
			DLP) to continually monitor critical
			IT assets and data movement. Such
			tools automatically generate incidents
		based on the rules.</p>

		<h3 class="head-font20 clr_org">4. Disaster Recovery & Business
		Continuity</h3>

		<p class="wow fadeInUp">Hindustan Zinc conducted a business
			impact analysis (BIA) for all critical IT
			systems and defined RPO and RTO for
			these systems in collaboration with,
			and on approval by respective system
			owners and functional business
			heads. Our business continuity
			plan (BCP) considers various risks,
			including technical, natural disasters
			and human risks including those
		related to external partners</p>

		<div class="org-box-risk">
			<h3 class="head-font20 clr_black">Cybersecurity Awareness
			Planning & Training</h3>
			<p class="wow fadeInUp">To build the team’s capability
				to identify and report breaches,
				Hindustan Zinc has prepared
				a holistic Cybersecurity
				Awareness Plan, which is
				executed throughout the year.
				Awareness areas include all the
				important domains of IT and OT
				security and data governance.
				All new joinees are mandated
				to attend the cybersecurity
				training during their on-
				boarding process. Additionally,
				an online awareness training
				capsule on self-service mode
				is available to all users. The
				information security function
				tracks and monitors the status
				of the self-training conducted
				by the user, and accordingly
				carries out periodic follow-ups
				to propagate the learnings.
				Periodic trainings are also
				arranged through virtual
				classrooms on a voluntary /
				self-nomination basis. Guidance
				is circulated periodically to
				all users on how to classify
				information as per the
				information classification policy
			of the Company.</p>
