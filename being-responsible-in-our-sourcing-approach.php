    <h4 class="head-font20 wow fadeInUp clr_white">Enabling Inventory Consolidation & Management <br>
    MIGRATING FROM INDIVIDUAL STORES TO MEGA WAREHOUSE</h4>

    <p class="wow fadeInUp">To get full visibility and control of the Company’s entire inventory, our supply chain team decided to consolidate the same at a single mega warehouse. The team felt the move would help bring in inventory optimisation, reduction in working capital, standardisation of spares, best-in-class storage facility, and a convenient use-and-pay model for seamless management of inventory.</p>

    <p class="wow fadeInUp">TVS Supply Chain Solutions is our warehouse partner, and a central warehouse spanning over 3.5 lacs sq ft has been set up near Udaipur airport. Currently, store migration from smelter is under last leg of execution, to be followed by mines’ store migration. Inbound deliveries from business partners to mega warehouse and outbound deliveries to site locations have been initiated. This project is also crucial for integration of Use & Pay model for spare part management.</p>
